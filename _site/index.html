            <p>In sixth grade I discovered the Jailbreaking world in iOS and since then I've been experimenting with the Linux kernel and its various distributions and I've fallen in love with the UNIX world. This, in turn, led me to explore the InfoSec world, which is highly related to these operating systems. After having multple year of experience with Linux and the life I started studying CompSci on Universidad Francisco Marroquín and I have had many programming projects using different modern technologies to meet the goals set by the professors. From all the UNIX operating systems I've tried I love macOS the most because whilst using it I don't feel like there's a piece of software in between, I feel like I'm directly working on my ideas and I have come to realize that the reason for that is the great UX/UI which I aspire to design on all my projects. </p>

            <p>When I was around 7 years old I confessed with my mouth that Jesus is Lord and believed in my heart that God raised
                Him from the dead thus I praying the Sinner's Prayer accepting Jesus as my Savior. Ever since, I have wanted to learn
                more about the God I believe. I've aimed to achieve this by using of the tools that my parents and fellow pastors
                and have lent me, such as hermeneutics, ecegetics, homiletics, linguistics and theological tools to study the Holy Scriptures.
                This curiosity led me to engage in deep conversations with the well-known Chilean theologian Gonzalo Chamorro who got me involved
                in a theological literary group where we discussed the transcendent questions of <span
                    lang="grc"> ἄνθρωπος </span> (anthropos) and of <span lang="grc"> θεός</span> (Theos). Since then I've been reading many different academical books related to the Bible to further understand it and its important historical context. I've also started a Biblical-Academical blog which focuses on answering questions that the lay christian may ask themselves and might have some trouble answering, you can visit by going into "Blog" on the navbar.</p>

            <p>As a photographer I have learned to discuss requirements with clients, conduct research for each session, use technical equipment, network with other professionals, organize backgrounds for photo sessions, process images, and I have learned a lot about self-marketing. However, photographers are artists with a camera, thus using a mix of technical skills and an artistic eye I have developed the ability to take portrait, location, landscape or food photos that express meaning and are well understood. I have shot weddings, conferences, personal projects, street photography and religious services.</p>

            <p>Since the ninth grade I was on my high school robotics team. Together with my friends we entered into many competitions
            at the local, national, Latin American and global levels. Winning many of them. We developed our robots and software in
            different platforms and languages, amongst my favourites I can mention Arduino which is particulary good for learning
            and VEX which was very good for competitions.</p>

            <p>In this three years I've been studying (I have one more left) the design of computers and computational systems both practical and theoretical systems. Unlike Systems Engineering students, I deal mostly with software and algorithms; this includes their theory, design, development, optimization and application.</p>

            <p>I studied at this school since I was two years old, this helped me to strongly grow the values of perseverance and discipline. The intention of studying in a Christian school was to be able to develop friendships with values similar to those transmitted by my parents.</p>
