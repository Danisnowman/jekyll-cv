    company: UFM or elsewhere
    description: For as long as I can remember I have been very interested in science. When I was in kindergarten, the coordinator would lend me elementary science books so that I could learn on my own about subjects that I would not see for a handful of years. In sixth grade I discovered Jailbreaks in iOS and since then I started to experiment with the Linux kernel and its various distributions.  This in turn led me to seek to explore the security of these operating systems and to enter the world of InfoSec.

    description: Since the ninth grade I was on my high school robotics team. Together with my friends we entered into many competitions at the local, national, Latin American and global levels. Winning many of them. We developed our robots and software in different platforms and languages, amongst my favourites I can mention Arduino which is particulary good for learning and VEX which was very good for competitions.

    company: '@danisnowman & @vidarealtv'
    description: As a photographer I have learned to discuss requirements with clients, conduct research for each session, use technical equipment, network with other professionals, organize backgrounds for photo sessions, process images, and I have learned a lot about self-marketing. However, photographers are artists with a camera, thus using a mix of technical skills and an artistic eye I have developed the ability to take portrait, location, landscape or food photos that express meaning and are well understood. I have shot weddings, conferences, personal projects, street photography and religious services.

    company: Iglesia Vida Real tv
    description: When I was around 7 years old I confessed with my mouth that Jesus is Lord and believed in my heart that God raised Him from the dead thus I prayed the Sinner's Prayer accepting Jesus as my Savior. Ever since, I have wanted to learn more about the God I believe. I've aimed to achieve this by using of the tools that my parents and fellow pastors and have lent me, such as hermeneutic, homiletic, linguistic and theological tools to study the Holy Scriptures. This curiosity led me to engage in deep conversations with the well-known Chilean theologian Gonzalo Chamorro who involved me in a theological literary group where we discussed for a long time the transcendent questions of <span lang= "grc"> ἄνθρωπος </span> (anthropos) and of <span lang= "grc"> θεός</span> (Theos).
